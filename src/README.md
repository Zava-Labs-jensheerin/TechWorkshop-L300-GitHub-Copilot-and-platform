## Session Management

- Cart operations (update, remove)

Logs are written to console during development.

## Chat Feature (Phi4 Foundry)

This app includes a simple chat page at `/Chat` that sends user prompts to the Microsoft Foundry Phi4 endpoint and displays responses.

### Configuration

Add the following to your `appsettings.json` or use environment variables:

```
"Foundry": {
  "Endpoint": "https://<your-foundry-endpoint>/v1/chat/completions",
  "ApiKey": "<your-api-key>"
}
```

**Do not commit your API key to source control.**

- For production, use Azure Key Vault or environment variables to provide secrets.
- The API key is read from configuration and injected via DI.

### How it works
- Visit `/Chat` in the browser
- Type a prompt and click Send
- The response from the Phi4 model is appended to the conversation area

### Required Services
- `IFoundryService` and `FoundryService` handle API calls
- Registered in DI in `Program.cs`

### Smoke Test
- Visit `/Chat`, send a prompt, and verify model response appears
